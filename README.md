# birthday_reminder_bot

The biggest pain of my life - I missed my best friend's birthday.

I kept all the knowledge about the birthdays of my friends and relatives in a bot in Telegram - and then the hosting of this bot decided to end (although I was ready to pay for the hosting, I just didn't know where)

I am a programmer, if there is no ready-made reliable solution, I have to write it myself

## TODO

- Make auto deleting logs
- Make backup pring sorted by today date
- Make Years old count
